addrgen - Minimal Bitcoin address generator in Python

Created and Licensed Public Domain by Joric/bitcoin-dev June 2012 with minor modifications by David Sterry.

This script generates a single Bitcoin address and prints it with its private key.

The Bitcoin address is generated using the compressed public key format.

If you wish to generate addresses based on a passphrase, a given private key, or some other option look at the commented lines in the test() function.
